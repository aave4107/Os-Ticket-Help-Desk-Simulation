# Os-Ticket-Help-Desk-Simulation
On a Virtual Machine from Azure I installed a program named osTicket this is used in real jobs and it is to demonstrate how different roles involved in handling tickets do and why it is important and needed.

The picture above is using an end user account that I created that is going to send in a ticket.

I then log in as Agent John and I assess the problem/ticket by assigning it to the appropriate SLA I created earlier, since the problem seems to be a Large Scale problem I assign it to the one with the fastest respond time.

Next I assign it to the appropriate team since the ticket has to do with online banking portal not working I simply assign it to the Online Banking Team this is shown in the picture below

Next I login as Jane the SysAdmin Agent and work the ticket to completion.

I as Jane send in two replys on the osTicket System then I assign the priority as emergency and the status of the ticket as resolved.

Now the Ticket is officialy closed and worked to completion.
