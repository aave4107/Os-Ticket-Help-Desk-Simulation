# Os-Ticket-Help-Desk-Simulation
On a Virtual Machine from Azure, I installed a program named osTicket. This is used in real jobs, and it is to demonstrate what different roles involved in handling tickets do and why it is important and needed.

The picture above is using an end-user account that I created, which is going to send in a ticket.

I then log in as Agent John and I assess the problem/ticket by assigning it to the appropriate SLA I created earlier. Since the problem seems to be a large-scale problem, I assign it to the one with the fastest response time.

Next, I assign it to the appropriate team since the ticket has to do with the online banking portal not working. I simply assign it to the Online Banking Team this as shown in the picture below

Next, I log in as Jane the SysAdmin Agent and work the ticket to completion.

As Jane, send in two replies on the osTicket System, then I will assign the priority as emergency and the status of the ticket as resolved.

Now the Ticket is officially closed and has been worked to completion.
